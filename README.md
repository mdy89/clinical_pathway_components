Title: Data-driven Inference of Clinical Pathway Components for Identifying Basic Care Patterns from Electronic Health Records

The development of a clinical pathway is a labor-intensive process that requires the participation of experts in various areas including clinical and informatics domains. This process will be greatly facilitated if conformity of clinical guidelines is precisely measured and major variations in adopting them are captured from electronic health records (EHRs). From a data analytic perspective, this requires the establishment of mapping between clinical concepts and their representations in terms of EHR data elements, and their temporal formation as clinical activities. This paper introduces a data-driven informatics framework that maps clinical concepts of EHR elements to an embedding space based on their temporal co-occurrences and groups them into cohesive clusters of clinical concepts which we call "clinical activities." The paper illustrates how a set of clinical activities is discovered by applying the framework to an ischemic heart disease cohort of Veterans Affairs.
